# Crypto_Clustering 

## Project Description

Use your Python knowledge along with unsupervised machine learning knowledge to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

### Requirements

* crypto_market_data_csv

### Instructions

1. Load the crypto_market_data.csv file into a DataFrame and perform summary statistics and data visualization.
2. Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.<br>
3. Find the best value for k using the elbow method.
4. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data.
5. Perform PCA and reduce features to three principal components.
6. Find the best value for k using the PCA data.
7. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data.

### Dependencies

* Python
* Pandas
* Scikit.learn
* HvPlot
